# Osu-Multi-Tool
///Instructions\\\

 1 
  -(use any exe packer or other tool on the .exe, osu can detects its MD5 so i highly recomend doing this if you dont wanna get banned)
  -(or mess the source code a bit yourself, this way its more undetectable)

 2
  -(change the window name to of a known program youre not running)
  -(change the process name to the same of the program you used for the window)
 
 3
  -(use the search bar to search for a song)
  -(select Hardrock mod before loading)
  -(select its difficulty and load)
  -(select tool, initialize and play it)

 4
  -(look at the options, theres a lot of options there, change then for undetectability and better performance)
  -(go at the hotkeys options and change the hotkeys for the ones you want)
  
 5
  -(if you failed a song or exit it before finishing osu will continue playing it from the menu at the same part it stopped during play so the tools will continue to run, to stop it press the hotkey designed to "stop" or press the stop button, but if aimbot is on using the hotkey is better)

 6
  -(if you get a error when loading a song send the song and difficulty used with the error code in pm to me)
  -(error 23 may happen sometimes, the song can still be played but slider breaking may happen)
  -(if beat divisor of a song is 1 or 2 slider breaking is possible)
